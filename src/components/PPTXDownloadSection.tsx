The new leave is in addition to the current entitlement of three days of unpaid sick leave. Full- and part-time employees covered by the ESA who have worked for their employer at least 90 days are eligible. However, the ESA does not cover federally regulated sectors, self-employed workers, and explicitly excluded professions and occupations. Employers must pay an average day’s pay for each day of sick leave, using a pay calculation formula. Employees intending to take paid leave do not have to provide advance notification, but employers can request proof of illness or injury. British Columbia is the third province in Canada to enact paid sick leave and the first to provide this amount of leave. The government estimates that more than one million workers in the province currently do not have access to paid sick leave.",
